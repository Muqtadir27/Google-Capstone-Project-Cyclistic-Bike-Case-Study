# üö¥ Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study #
Welcome to the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This case study explores ride data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. Based on these insights, strategic recommendations are made to help the company increase annual memberships.

## üìå Project Overview ##
Cyclistic operates a successful bike-sharing program offering two types of user plans: casual (pay-as-you-go) and annual memberships. As the company‚Äôs marketing team aims to boost the number of long-term customers, it becomes vital to understand:

Who the riders are,

How they use the service, and

What patterns or preferences exist between different user types.

This analysis leverages real-world data (from Divvy) to derive actionable insights that can drive business decisions and marketing strategies.

## üß≠ Business Task ##
Key Question
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Business Objective ###
The main objective is to analyze user behavior and generate data-driven recommendations that the marketing team can use to convert casual riders into annual members. This involves segmenting users, identifying usage trends, and pinpointing differences that can inform personalized campaigns and service improvements.

### üîç Data Source ###
The data for this case study comes from Divvy‚Äôs public trip data, which contains detailed records of bike trips taken using the Cyclistic system.

Time Period: January 2022 to December 2022

Format: CSV files, one for each month

Content: Trip start and end times, bike types, start/end stations, user types, and more

Note: All personally identifiable information (PII) has been removed or anonymized to comply with privacy regulations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies ##
Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, wrangling, and initial exploration.

Power BI: Employed for building rich, interactive visualizations that illustrate user trends and insights.

PDF Report: Final report documenting the entire process, findings, and recommendations.

These tools provided an accessible and efficient environment to handle large datasets and communicate insights effectively.

Engineered new features like ride duration, day of the week, and time of day for deeper insights.

#### Analyze: ####

Performed descriptive statistics and pattern recognition.

Compared user behaviors based on ride length, frequency, and usage days.

Suggested actions based on data-backed conclusions.





## üìä Key Findings ##
#### Usage Patterns ####

Annual members tend to use bikes more consistently throughout the week, indicating commuting or habitual usage.

Casual riders show peak activity during weekends, suggesting recreational use.

#### Ride Duration ####

Casual riders generally take longer rides on average than members, potentially due to leisure rather than efficiency.

#### Time of Day & Seasonality ####

Casual riders are more active during afternoons and evenings, especially in summer months, aligning with tourist activity.

Annual members display steadier patterns across all months, reflecting year-round utility.

Several high-traffic routes are predominantly used by casual riders, signaling high marketing potential zones.

Station-level analysis reveals opportunities to optimize bike availability for each user type.
